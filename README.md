# OpenStreetMap
This project involved developing a sophisticated maps application using C++ and real-world data sourced from OpenStreetMap (OSM). The primary goal was to implement a robust graph data structure capable of efficient pathfinding between geographical locations represented as nodes, connected by edges derived from OSM data. The application used sets with directed, simple, or weighted edges with real-world data. I engineered a modified version of Dijkstra’s Algorithm with an enhanced STL priority_queue, which enabled the shortest path calculations between building points with dynamic priority updates. I developed a comprehensive suite of Google Tests to validate the functionality and reliability of both the graph data structure and the modified Dijkstra’s algorithm. These tests rigorously assessed performance under various scenarios, ensuring robustness and correctness across different map configurations and edge conditions.

My enhanced STL priority_queue facilitated dynamic priority updates, crucial for calculating the shortest paths between building points efficiently. Your modifications ensured that the pathfinding algorithm adapted dynamically to changes in node priorities, optimizing performance and accuracy in navigating complex urban environments. 

My contributions to this project underscore your proficiency in software engineering, particularly in designing and implementing complex algorithms and data structures for geographic information systems. By successfully enhancing Dijkstra’s algorithm and implementing a versatile graph data structure, I demonstrated my ability to translate theoretical concepts into practical solutions for real-world applications. My commitment to quality assurance through thorough testing further ensured the reliability and scalability of the maps application.
